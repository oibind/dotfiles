2019-03-08 00:29:44	CyberShadow	Well, I had to make that choice a few years ago, currently all my data is in btrfs snapshots. I might migrate to ZOL at some point in the future, certainly after 0.8. ZOL has a bunch of missing features compared to btrfs like shrinking, file range cloning, and more flexible snapshots. The other issue is being out-of-tree, which complicates rescuing systems esp. over KVM or such.
2019-03-08 00:29:56	vvor	I'm with btrfs but would never put it on top of lvm. Checking out ZOL for missing stuff on btrfs.
