2019-02-28 17:10:24	Helenski	Damn. 
2019-02-28 17:10:41	dsrkane	It is Saturday?
2019-02-28 17:11:07	dsrkane	Or at least that's what Emma originally said.
2019-02-28 17:11:22	Helenski	Saturday, deffo. Friday, can't. 
2019-02-28 17:11:22	dsrkane	@e.m., has it been moved to Friday (tomorrow)?
2019-02-28 17:11:43	e.m.	nope friday

2019-03-02 10:33:01	Helenski	So what time is the bit where everyone shouts "Surprise!!!!"? 
2019-03-02 13:17:03	e.m.	:thinking_face:  not actually sure. Guessing 9. That's why we have to be there for then?
2019-03-02 13:18:21	philtweir	Just in case there's anything I need to fish for, he's here in Farset w me? [:fishing_pole_and_fish:2 :fish:1 :gladfish:1]
2019-03-02 14:07:42	e.m.	I dont know what marks told him or how he's getting him to the sunflower. Be interesting to know what Martin thinks he's doing tonight :joy:
2019-03-02 14:57:53	dsrkane	Do we know which direction Marty is coming from this evening? I'd like to park close to the pub without giving the game away...
2019-03-02 14:59:04	philtweir	It could be any Jaguar on North St
2019-03-02 14:59:48	dsrkane	Tbf, two friends of mine are also in the market for buying similar vehicles. We intend to drive around everywhere at high speed together.
2019-03-02 15:00:08	dsrkane	It'll all be fun and games until a Provo gets the wrong end of the stick (of dynamite).
2019-03-02 15:00:32	philtweir	D Kane's Jag Race [:kittybigclap:2]
2019-03-02 15:01:37	philtweir	To answer the original question - I don't know, but I can try fishing :fishing_pole_and_fish:
2019-03-02 15:02:07	philtweir	He's just got a haircut, so he must suspect something's up

2019-03-02 15:02:37	philtweir	(unless they're doing something over dinner, which would explain the late start)
2019-03-02 15:03:53	philtweir	i'd be up for some pizza in the sunflower first, as @e.m. suggested, if it wouldn't give any game away [:pizza:3]
2019-03-02 16:48:57	philtweir	So I tried fishing and ended up in a debate about business analysis :thinking_face: [:facepalm:1 :smile:1]
2019-03-02 16:49:47	philtweir	I'm still not clear what his timing is, but probably will be pretty obvious if i try again :joy: [:joy:1]
2019-03-02 17:06:56	Helenski	I live next door to him, I'll have to go out the car park exit! 
2019-03-02 17:14:01	andyluke	@Helenski He may try to return home. Put traffic cones around his front door.
2019-03-02 17:14:29	e.m.	Business analysis??
2019-03-02 17:14:37	andyluke	You may want to place an electronic tracker on him too.
2019-03-02 17:14:42	e.m.	Wut? :joy: [:100:1]
2019-03-02 17:36:57	philtweir	I'll try and remember to message here if/when he disappears
2019-03-02 17:42:45	e.m.	@philtweir what time were you thinking to get there for :pizza: ?
2019-03-02 17:42:56	philtweir	open to suggestion...
2019-03-02 17:48:57	e.m.	How about 745? 
2019-03-02 18:14:21	philtweir	Works for me!
2019-03-02 18:15:36	philtweir	Heads up, the Naughton has left the building, the Naughton has left the building ( @Helenski hide!)
2019-03-02 18:16:23	philtweir	:farsetlabs: is Martino-free
2019-03-02 18:17:12	dsrkane	The eagle has alighted upon the Werther's Original. I REPEAT, the eagle...
2019-03-02 18:18:33	philtweir	I'm still waiting for the rest of the repeat :sad_parrot:
2019-03-02 18:18:53	dsrkane	I have been strangled by a Nazi honeypot, soz.
2019-03-02 18:19:12	philtweir	ping to @mayc
2019-03-02 18:19:24	philtweir	may wish to take action.
2019-03-02 18:20:01	dsrkane	If she's on the run, you May Nazi her this evening. (edited) [:trollface:1 :kittyclap:1]

2019-03-02 18:20:58	mayc	I leave the room for 5 minutes and he gets himself strangled...ffs

2019-03-02 18:21:54	mayc	Not the one I wanted
2019-03-02 18:21:58	dsrkane	Cheers, now she's trying to murder through seizures.
2019-03-02 18:22:14	philtweir	This is not an image I previously associated with Nazi honeypot assassinations (edited)
2019-03-02 18:22:40	dsrkane	Just want to clarify, if this is all of us _before_ alcohol, tonight is going to be messy.

2019-03-02 18:22:50	Helenski	Yay! 
2019-03-02 18:23:12	philtweir	@dsrkane: and by "Nazi honeypot", I mean "complex windowblind"
2019-03-02 18:23:21	philtweir	now the truth is out
2019-03-02 18:23:31	Helenski	Wonder where Marty went? 
2019-03-02 18:23:36	dsrkane	The scale of my defeat was more heroic before that was known.
2019-03-02 18:23:44	mayc	Home? Dinner with Mark?
2019-03-02 18:23:57	philtweir	He'd got a haircut _and_ trimmed his beard
2019-03-02 18:24:03	mayc	If home, you're going to have to hide @Helenski !
2019-03-02 18:24:14	mayc	Are we sure he isn't going on a date?!
2019-03-02 18:24:28	philtweir	:eyes:
2019-03-02 18:24:29	dsrkane	Also, if Marty looks nonplussed at the surprise party, I'm going to be screaming, "I had to fight through Nazis, windowblinds, and Nazi windowblinds to get here, for _fuck's_ sake!" [:+1:2]
2019-03-02 18:24:35	philtweir	"several people are typing" again :smile:
2019-03-02 18:24:53	dsrkane	Because that'll definitely straighten things out in his mind.
2019-03-02 18:24:56	mayc	Or _thinks_ he's going on a date? He's gonna be mighty disappointed, if so.
2019-03-02 18:25:00	mayc	Or not. 
2019-03-02 18:25:08	Helenski	Hahaha, hope he isn't expecting a date. Well he's got a date with us all.  [:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:2 :kittyhugeclap:1]
2019-03-02 18:25:29	mayc	Woo...hoo? (edited)
2019-03-02 18:25:48	philtweir	So, I'm feeling like this evening is going to be highly educational on many levels [:mortar_board:2]
2019-03-02 18:25:51	dsrkane	He'll have a lucky escape if his imaginary date was actually a Nazi honeypot, although... I suppose being imaginary would blunt the lethality of the whole affair.
2019-03-02 18:26:10	philtweir	If you see a window blind, swipe left
2019-03-02 18:26:29	Helenski	Hahaha! 
2019-03-02 18:26:54	dsrkane	That's what it wants you to do, while the little shit of a pullcord moves sneakily right for the kill. [:joy:1]
2019-03-02 18:30:04	Helenski	So I plan to arrive around 8 30 to be on the safe side. (Having taken a stealthy route to avoid Marty).  [:+1:1]
2019-03-02 18:31:13	WarriorEmpressZoe	i'm gonna go early and do work
2019-03-02 18:31:24	WarriorEmpressZoe	@AndrewWalter!!!!! are you still coming? [:+1:1]
2019-03-02 18:31:32	Helenski	Wow @WarriorEmpressZoe  ! 
2019-03-02 18:33:02	WarriorEmpressZoe	well. not really.
2019-03-02 18:33:26	philtweir	I'll aim for 7.45 w @e.m. but we can hide down the back corner, just in case they arrive early - I'd be surprised tho, cos Mark'll know people'll come in in dribs and drabs :shrug:
2019-03-02 18:33:34	Helenski	Go early and eat pizza surely? 
2019-03-02 18:33:42	WarriorEmpressZoe	7
2019-03-02 18:34:36	Helenski	Surprise events take a lot of stage managing! 
2019-03-02 18:34:48	philtweir	on a side note, is this finally a channel i can safely admit i put envelopes in the non-recycling bin :shocked_face_with_exploding_head:
2019-03-02 18:35:00	Helenski	Hahahaha! 
2019-03-02 18:35:19	Helenski	Here's a dirty word... PLASTIC! 
2019-03-02 18:35:45	WarriorEmpressZoe	JESUS 7.45 IS TOO LATE
2019-03-02 18:36:14	WarriorEmpressZoe	i'm planning on being sufficiently drunk by 8
2019-03-02 18:36:24	philtweir	7.45 in the MORNING. We've been here for 11 hours already @WarriorEmpressZoe!!
2019-03-02 18:36:35	philtweir	I've eaten so much pizza, I'm wheel shaped
2019-03-02 18:36:56	WarriorEmpressZoe	you're always wheel shaped....?
2019-03-02 18:37:04	philtweir	round abouts
2019-03-02 18:37:48	Helenski	You two are clearly already drunk. 
2019-03-02 18:37:59	WarriorEmpressZoe	yourtee drunku
2019-03-02 18:38:00	philtweir	After 11 hours, I'm not surprised

2019-03-02 18:38:34	philtweir	is this one of those word puzzles?
2019-03-02 18:38:50	WarriorEmpressZoe	listen to your work wife
2019-03-02 18:39:02	philtweir	everyone needs a work wife balance
2019-03-02 18:39:11	Helenski	If people are this drunk without drinking yet it's gonna be the best night everrrrrrr! 
2019-03-02 18:39:18	WarriorEmpressZoe	who's not drinking?
2019-03-02 18:39:21	WarriorEmpressZoe	BODY SHOTS
2019-03-02 18:41:09	philtweir	Meanwhile, I'm getting pinged every 30s by an outage, but can't get it set back up as I need to keep replying :grimacing:
2019-03-02 18:41:39	WarriorEmpressZoe	someone remove phil
2019-03-02 18:42:06	Helenski	Let's keep this channel forever. For planning our drinking. 
2019-03-02 18:42:57	philtweir	(it's OK, it's nothing catastrophic. unlike this channel)
2019-03-02 18:44:32	mayc	Another dirty phrase we can't say around Martini: just chuck it in the general waste/skip [:blush:1]
2019-03-02 18:51:08	WarriorEmpressZoe	ok but in all seriousness if martin doesn't show up tonight can we party with his friends? [:100:2 :+1:1]
2019-03-02 18:51:46	philtweir	he just asked me a question on RC about php linting, so i'm not sure he's up to a _lot_ of raucous activity right now
2019-03-02 18:52:42	mayc	I'm sure we can change that later. 
2019-03-02 18:52:51	mayc	That sounded ominous.  [:joy:2]
2019-03-02 18:53:09	philtweir	Pullcord in the bag [:fishing_pole_and_fish:1]
2019-03-02 18:53:12	WarriorEmpressZoe	that sounds much more fun
2019-03-02 18:58:01	e.m.	Marks meeting Marty at 815. And then making their way to sunflower via a drink enroute. So we're fine to hangout at sunflower
2019-03-02 18:58:45	e.m.	I just had this horrible thought... Does the sunflower do pizza on a Saturday? I _think_ it does ..
2019-03-02 19:05:24	philtweir	:open_mouth:
2019-03-02 19:07:47	dsrkane	If it doesn't, you'll have a public disturbance on your hands. :joy: 
2019-03-02 19:15:02	philtweir	And with 11 hours of body shots, the window blind honeypot, me shaped like a wheel and a series of miscategorized recyclable goods, the sunflower genuinely will not know what hit them
2019-03-02 19:18:02	philtweir	@oibind @WarriorEmpressZoe shall we make a move from farset shortly?
2019-03-02 19:18:09	WarriorEmpressZoe	yes
2019-03-02 19:45:21	e.m.	I'm in taxi be there in 10
2019-03-02 19:49:01	philtweir	Landed in
2019-03-02 19:50:14	mayc	Just about to leave house
2019-03-02 19:51:31	e.m.	Any free tables/space to hangout?
2019-03-02 19:53:35	philtweir	We're out by pizzas!
2019-03-02 20:17:42	Helenski	Walking! Still outside by the pizzas? 
2019-03-02 20:18:37	e.m.	Yes!
2019-03-02 20:19:31	Helenski	Yay! 
2019-03-02 20:20:14	Richard	@Richard has left the group
2019-03-02 22:37:07	e.m.	@bolster?? Where are you?
2019-03-03 02:36:15	Helenski	That was super craic. 
2019-03-03 08:36:07	e.m.	Omg 236? How late did you guys stay out?? Did you make it to the Kremlin?
2019-03-03 10:17:29	WarriorEmpressZoe	I'm still out ;p Surpassed 7.45 at least  [:heart:1]
2019-03-03 10:41:33	Helenski	I almost went to the Kremlin! Next time. 
2019-03-03 12:23:22	mayc	Hallions :stuck_out_tongue: Had far too early a start for a Sunday.  Stupid responsibilities.
2019-03-03 22:08:59	e.m.	Looks like we achieved the aim of fun! ;) I got up and out for my cycle. My legs are now officially deaded. Was lovely to see you all. As I don't work Farset way I don't see yous as much. We should fix that and organise more stuff. Preferably before the Sept opera :joy:

2019-03-04 13:08:14	WarriorEmpressZoe	should we add martino here now?
2019-03-04 13:37:38	dsrkane	I don't think we should subject the poor man to a) craic about recycling; b) a lot of very hyper conversation and; c) the Nazi honeypot. :joy:
2019-03-04 13:41:59	Helenski	We could just start a drinking channel instead! 
2019-03-04 13:44:02	bolster	#social
2019-03-04 13:44:15	bolster	well, maybe not, you’ll just get content marketing bullshit for the next 6 months…
2019-03-04 13:44:47	bolster	(Sorry I couldn’t make it, got tied up with something :cold_sweat:)
2019-03-04 13:45:27	bolster	Maybe we need an #social-IRL channel for people wanting to be social in the ‘outside’ :smile:
2019-03-04 13:45:39	bolster	(Or just steal #wee-pint from NITD)
