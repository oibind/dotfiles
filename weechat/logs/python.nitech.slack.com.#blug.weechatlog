2019-03-02 14:13:04	peter.reid	they were still using one at the school my mum used to work at when she was left, and that was only 7 years ago [:joy:1]
2019-03-02 14:29:50	philtweir	There's the programmable rovers as well, if that'd count? think @marty was looking for those last year, might know
2019-03-02 14:37:57	tyndyll	cheers @dsrkane  [:+1:1]
2019-03-02 14:38:13	tyndyll	I’ve submitted a talk and a visual aid is always good
2019-03-02 15:19:55	Noodles	I always wanted to play with a proper Logo turtle. We just had to make do with the on screen type. :disappointed:
2019-03-02 16:44:10	alanfoster	TIL there exists physical turtles :o
2019-03-02 16:49:04	mistralol	@Noodles I used one as a kid. They were like bigtrack they used to never turn accuratly
2019-03-02 19:18:13	laches1sm	I remember that @tyndyll !!!

2019-03-02 23:18:08	tyndyll	That used to be the retort to a friend of ours - “Do you remember the falklands? I don’t”. It finally bit me on the arse when someone hit me with “Do you remember the first gulf war? I don’t”... 
2019-03-02 23:18:29	peter.reid	there was a first gulf war?
2019-03-02 23:18:49	peter.reid	`/s` - well somewhat...i didn't learn about it until well after the second one had finished..

2019-03-02 23:21:20	laches1sm	what's a gulf war @tyndyll? [:lol:1]
2019-03-02 23:22:24	laches1sm	is that when folk get upset after too much code golf?
2019-03-03 08:22:11	markxa	Do you remember the first Boer War? I don't.
2019-03-03 10:16:53	Noodles	I was there, but it bored me and I've forgotten it. [:punhusky:6]

2019-03-04 15:28:11	laches1sm	:joy:
2019-03-04 15:28:24	mistralol	pico = nano before it separated from pine
2019-03-04 15:28:35	laches1sm	nah, it was def nano
2019-03-04 15:28:54	laches1sm	was helping with some dockerfile fuckery and he opens up nano :sad-parrot:
2019-03-04 15:29:07	Noodles	Well he's management, right? No accounting for taste there.
2019-03-04 15:29:20	laches1sm	:joy: don’t worry i taught him some vi
2019-03-04 15:29:58	philtweir	But maybe taste for accounting? [:fast-parrot:1]
2019-03-04 15:30:42	tyndyll	Nano was the default on FreeBSD for a while? [:this:1]
2019-03-04 15:31:10	Noodles	I think it's the default on Debian these days too.
2019-03-04 15:31:12	laches1sm	you also see a lot of folk using it to install Arch
2019-03-04 15:31:28	Noodles	(it used to be one of the vi clones, but apparently that's not helpful)
2019-03-04 23:41:26	dsrkane	@tyndyll, I'm an idiot and clean forgot to look in Farset for that tonight. :facepalm: I'll take a look next time I'm down, sorry!
2019-03-05 09:31:27	philtweir	Not 100% sure where this fits _but_ anyone know where to start (or even a brand on Amazon) to replace a MacBook hard drive? Asking for a friend
2019-03-05 09:32:52	philtweir	Terabyte was suggested, but apparently there's quite a range of options. I, as you might imagine, haven't a clue
2019-03-05 09:34:26	peter.reid	what model of macbook do you know?
2019-03-05 09:34:34	peter.reid	tends to vary from model to model
2019-03-05 09:35:23	peter.reid	i can highly recommend https://www.ifixit.com/ for any Macbook related teardowns etc

2019-03-05 10:50:48	dsrkane	IIRC from my own days of doing this with a 2011 MacBook, Crucial had a good tool for both the RAM and SSDs. Pricier, but fire-and-forget.
2019-03-05 10:54:13	mistralol	don't suppose anyone knows of any tools to produce a call graph for a c++ program from a binary?
2019-03-05 10:54:21	mistralol	without actually running the code
2019-03-05 11:04:23	lskillen	@mistralol - I got curious so did a quick search too. Some decent answers here: https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/16081/how-to-generate-the-call-graph-of-a-binary-file - radare2 and angr (a python framework) look rather interesting. (edited)
2019-03-05 11:05:30	lskillen	Look at dat graphics: https://www.radare.org/r/img/webui-graph.png
2019-03-05 11:05:30		848x806px image
2019-03-05 11:20:34	tyndyll	@philtweir Easiest thing to do is just phone Macsys and get them to do it [:this:1]
2019-03-05 11:34:23	mistralol	radare looks interesting... Been trying to make a dot file for 30 minutes now :disappointed:
2019-03-05 11:54:04	Noodles	I have never managed to get the hang of radare. I know it's probably what I want some of the time, but the steep learning curve just means I go back to objdump.
2019-03-05 13:26:04	mistralol	I can see why as well :confused:
2019-03-05 13:43:44	lskillen	http://angr.io (angr.io) looks interesting too, and it's written in Python, installable via pip (edited)
2019-03-05 13:44:40	lskillen	https://docs.angr.io/built-in-analyses/cfg (edited)
2019-03-05 15:38:13	Noodles	Hey, sweet. I submitted a PR to systemd to fix my laptop keymap out of the box and now that fix is in Debian. The system works sometimes. ;) [:party-parrot:3 :tada:2]
2019-03-05 15:54:25	mistralol	How much lag was there?
2019-03-05 15:56:50	Noodles	About a month? TBH I didn't expect it to make Buster.
2019-03-05 16:13:51	keith.maxwell	A PR? What happened to patches, mailing lists and open standards? A PR is a proprietary GitHub thing right? :trolldance:
2019-03-05 16:14:09	keith.maxwell	On a more serious not that is cool, I was expecting much more delay
2019-03-05 16:23:12	mistralol	no a pr is a git thing
2019-03-05 16:27:39	mistralol	looked specially timed before buster was released :smile:
2019-03-05 16:38:29	Noodles	@keith.maxwell: systemd is maintained in GitHub so it was a GitHub style PR. Does make drive-by contributions easy, I'll give it that... [:heart:1]
2019-03-05 17:12:26	keith.maxwell	@mistralol PRs are a more a GitHub thing than a git thing, even the section in the git book talks about GitHub https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project ; some open source projects refuse to mandate GitHub workflows because it isn't free (libre) enough, other's like systemd it appears just get on with life :smile:
2019-03-05 17:13:41	Noodles	I think GitHub popularised the "PR" concept, but I'm sure Linus talks about "pull requests" for pulls to the kernel.
2019-03-05 17:14:28	sigma	But git pull-request... :) 
2019-03-05 17:15:32	mistralol	@keith.maxwell I don't agree :slightly_smiling_face: But github kinda does them differently and somewhat incorrectly (nobody seems to notice this either) from the original intention of git
2019-03-05 17:16:32	Noodles	Why incorrectly?
2019-03-05 17:17:04	sigma	I was wrong, it'd request-pull https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull
2019-03-05 17:17:06	keith.maxwell	Should we talk about `rp`? The only built in command I can see is `git request-pull` which helps with an email
2019-03-05 17:17:21	keith.maxwell	@sigma jinx! :smile:
2019-03-05 17:17:25	mistralol	Its the forced fork on the github side. fork's need maintained and the clone -> hack -> fork -> push to fork breaks a bunch of useful git functions in the local copy
2019-03-05 17:18:06	Noodles	How do you avoid the fork without allowing people to other people's repos without any checks?
2019-03-05 17:18:36	Noodles	I'm not sure I've lost any functionality by having multiple remote repos for things I've worked on.
2019-03-05 17:18:45	mistralol	The "clone" is the fork or should be enough of a fork from the original repo for a non maintained to edit and send a patch for review / inclusion.
2019-03-05 17:19:00	mistralol	so the original method of this way by mailing a "git format-patch" (edited)
2019-03-05 17:19:06	Noodles	The "clone" is not publicly accessible.
2019-03-05 17:19:17	sigma	You could have a general request pull from random git enabled URL feature
2019-03-05 17:19:27	Noodles	GH provides some public hosting of repos, along with a neat way of tying those repos with their "parents".
2019-03-05 17:19:30	mistralol	the clone doesn't need to be publicly accessible. The patch does
2019-03-05 17:19:35	sigma	But yeh would need a Public git repo somewhere
2019-03-05 17:20:00	Noodles	GH doesn't stop normal git workflow. You can send me an email patch and I can apply it to my git checkout and push.
2019-03-05 17:20:07	Noodles	It just adds an additional method.
2019-03-05 17:20:22	sigma	Mistralol, you might like http://sr.ht (sr.ht) 
2019-03-05 17:20:28	mistralol	Yeah I get that too But how come github doesn't have a "submit patch" button without the fork?
2019-03-05 17:20:51	Noodles	And cut and paste the patch into it?
2019-03-05 17:21:07	mistralol	or a shell script to do a git format-patch and upload it?
2019-03-05 17:21:20	Noodles	Upload it to *where*?
2019-03-05 17:21:26	mistralol	github....
2019-03-05 17:21:45	Noodles	In a private repo, like, say, a fork of the original in the namespace of the patch submitter?
2019-03-05 17:22:06	sigma	Same places as the issues get stored maybe?
2019-03-05 17:22:20	sigma	Not sure how you'd implement it
2019-03-05 17:22:43	mistralol	The clone -> push to fork. The moment you fork + push you actually technically become a sub maintainer if the repo is public. So you cannot locally use such things like git rebase -i etc.. because you cannot push to the fork again without doing a forced override
2019-03-05 17:23:45	sigma	Out of curiousity has anyone else got an http://sr.ht (sr.ht) account?
2019-03-05 17:23:51	Noodles	I regularly rebase in forks in the same way as I regularly rebase in private clones. Not sure what the issue is? You shouldn't assume my clones are always linearly updated. ;)
2019-03-05 17:23:55	sigma	It really is quite nice
2019-03-05 17:24:05	mistralol	So if your patch is rejected. You end up having to do another commit + push. At the point the PR now has multiple commits against it based on code review/rejection. The maintainer then has to clean up the submitter's mess which puts more load on a central person
2019-03-05 17:24:26	Noodles	If you have a rejected PR you can update the PR branch and the PR gets automagically updated.
2019-03-05 17:25:13	Noodles	I'd just like to point out I'm more than happy with traditional git work flows and email patches, but I do think GitHub have usefully lowered the barrier to contributions.
2019-03-05 17:25:23	mistralol	yeah i know. But then you have a string of commits right? Then the maintainer is the only one who can clean that up. Cause if somebody decides to fork your fork you can't squash any more?
2019-03-05 17:25:28	Noodles	The objections I've seen about them is the locking in of the non-git metadata (such as issues)
2019-03-05 17:25:49	Noodles	If someone forks my working fork then fork them.
2019-03-05 17:26:05	Noodles	Caveat emptor.
2019-03-05 17:26:11	mistralol	can you see where i am coming from though?
2019-03-05 17:26:41	sigma	git series is also nice for this kind of thing, you an rebase patch series, review comments and all
2019-03-05 17:26:46	Noodles	You seem to object to the fact the submission is public and that therefore creates (in your eyes) a certain expectation upon that repo.
2019-03-05 17:27:02	Noodles	In this scene I will be playing @sigma and you will be playing me.
2019-03-05 17:27:29	sigma	Lol
2019-03-05 17:27:31	mistralol	ok, not confused at all now :stuck_out_tongue:
2019-03-05 17:27:47	Noodles	It's a bit of a rusty joke.
2019-03-05 17:27:58	mistralol	so its dead then? :smile: [:ferris:2]
2019-03-05 17:28:19	sigma	We've been on opposite sides of a similar philosophical debate today already :) 
2019-03-05 17:28:21	Noodles	I just got another PR merged. Rockin' [:tada:3 :party-parrot:1]
2019-03-05 17:28:57	sigma	The only PRs I've got done lately was to @philtweir's repo...
2019-03-05 17:29:36	sigma	But seriously, anyone els played with http://sr.ht (sr.ht)? :) 
2019-03-05 17:29:54	mistralol	no what is it?
2019-03-05 17:30:17	laches1sm	I’m curious
2019-03-05 17:30:17	mistralol	I also cannot get to sourcehut :confused:
2019-03-05 17:30:41	mistralol	Personally I prefer gerrit's workflow btw :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)
2019-03-05 17:31:55	Noodles	We use gerrit in work and I don't hate it for review stuff.
2019-03-05 17:32:02	sigma	https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-discuss
2019-03-05 17:32:38	mistralol	@sigma that something more like gerrit than github?
2019-03-05 17:32:45	sigma	http://sr.ht (sr.ht) is pretty much gitlab but with more conventional tools for interaction 
2019-03-05 17:33:13	sigma	So you _can_ mail patches etc, the repos have mailing lists etc (edited)
2019-03-05 17:34:07	sigma	It's still pretty alpha, but well enough funded to be self supporting afair
2019-03-05 17:34:51	keith.maxwell	Think http://sr.ht (sr.ht) is the old name and current short url, as of last month the official front page is https://sourcehut.org/
2019-03-05 17:34:51		sourcehut - the hacker's forge

2019-03-05 17:35:06	keith.maxwell	My experience with it so far is limited to reading the main contributor's blog
2019-03-05 17:35:52	sigma	I've a couple of invites if anyone wants to give it a go
2019-03-05 17:35:54	mistralol	The http://sourcehut.org (sourcehut.org) is blocked by firewall here :wink: [:facepalm:1]
2019-03-05 17:36:54	sigma	It's also all free software
2019-03-05 17:40:30	keith.maxwell	Good point! I think that's why I started the thread off - I had been pretty much exclusively on GitLab which is all free (and calls the same thing a MR) but I'm starting to use Azure DevOps with its more sophisticated issue tracking (almost Jira like, I think) and well its less free
2019-03-05 17:41:46	Noodles	GitLab is not 100% Free.
2019-03-05 17:42:01	Noodles	It has a Community Edition, which is Free.
2019-03-05 17:44:15	keith.maxwell	Might be that's a misconception on my part, I haven't set up the community edition recently, anyone know the big differences? (edited)

2019-03-05 17:45:32	Noodles	I know they moved a bunch of stuff to the community edition to make it useful for the GNOME and Debian folk.
2019-03-05 17:45:36	keith.maxwell	@mistralol does that help? I can't find the words community edition anywhere on that page?
2019-03-05 17:45:44	mistralol	core = free i think [:+1:1]
2019-03-05 17:47:25	sigma	Yeh, they're open core the same way the likes of puppet are
2019-03-05 17:49:02	mistralol	meanwhile I am still stuck with svn here :confused:
2019-03-05 17:49:39	Noodles	We just have the hardware folk left on svn.
2019-03-05 17:50:21	sigma	git-svn is actually pretty nice once you get over the initial import hump
2019-03-05 17:50:28	mistralol	Yeah we have a problem with it
2019-03-05 17:50:49	mistralol	Somebody a long time ago had a great idea to use the code repo for rpm's :wink:
2019-03-05 17:50:57	mistralol	so we have a serious "size" problem
2019-03-05 17:51:26	sigma	Yeh, your filter list to exclude those would get big
2019-03-05 17:51:52	mistralol	well at least they are mostly in a single path and they are above the main code
2019-03-05 17:52:09	mistralol	but how do people normally manage quite a large collection of rpm's out of a repo?
2019-03-05 17:52:54	mistralol	ideally including the building and signing stages
2019-03-05 17:53:28	mistralol	but preferably without setting up a complete distro set of infrastructure for dealing with it
2019-03-05 17:53:32	sigma	Ignore-paths on git svn is a good start
2019-03-05 17:53:57	sigma	Ahh, sorry, thought you were asking how to get them out of the repo :) 
2019-03-05 17:54:10	mistralol	Well... find . -type f -name "*.rpm" .......... | xargs NUKE (edited)
2019-03-05 17:54:30	sigma	That doesn't help with the history :P
2019-03-05 17:54:53	sigma	Svn seems a reasonable thing to manage binaries in (edited)
2019-03-05 17:55:14	mistralol	not really concerned about the history so much on the rpm and the changelog in them are mostly (I think) correct
2019-03-05 17:55:16	sigma	Now there's git lfs
2019-03-05 17:57:39	mistralol	don't support to know how it deals with a clone or fork?
2019-03-05 17:58:32	mistralol	the history of this stuff is 180GB+ btw.
2019-03-05 19:12:26	sigma	If you clone it it doesn't necessarily pull all the LFS files
2019-03-07 14:24:51	willix	@jonnymccullagh said BelFOSS is open for registration:

2019-03-07 14:24:51		BelFOSS | Free and Open Source Software Conference
2019-03-07 14:24:51		Great to have Proofpoint on-board as sponsors of BelFOSS 2019. Attendees of BelFOSS 2017 will remember Jolene Dunne describing Proofpoint's email security and we hope to hear more from them at BelFOSS 2019. Proofpoint's Belfast office is in Weaver's Court close to the Europa and Farset Labs. [:sweat_smile:1]
2019-03-07 14:27:31	Noodles	I was sure registration had been open before?
2019-03-07 14:29:45	mayc	Woohoo, I think I can go this year.
2019-03-07 14:30:15	jonnymccullagh	Yeah it's been open for a while @Noodles - I'm just now spending a few hours drumming up support!
2019-03-07 14:30:29	Noodles	I can't find any record of having actually signed up.
2019-03-07 14:30:37	jonnymccullagh	Great May @mayc maybe you could join the discussion panel
2019-03-07 14:30:56	jonnymccullagh	Don't worry Jonathan - you are on the list !
2019-03-07 14:31:20	jonnymccullagh	I need to send out emails to registered folks - need to sort out my SMTP creds first though
2019-03-07 14:31:29	jonnymccullagh	And wild busy with this minecraft project
2019-03-07 14:31:33	jonnymccullagh	and work of course

2019-03-07 15:36:03	bolster	@jonnymccullagh what? no “SLACK” option in “how did you find out about belfoss?”
2019-03-07 16:06:12	jonnymccullagh	:shame: (hides in shame)
2019-03-07 16:16:11	lskillen	I giggled at the age ranges on the BelFOSS registration - If you're 35, you're almost certainly picking that 25-35 range rather than the 35-45 range. :grinning: (edited) [:lol:1 :party_try_not_to_cry:3]

2019-03-04 15:28:54	laches1sm	was helping with some dockerfile fuckery and he opens up nano :sad-parrot:
2019-03-04 15:29:07	Noodles	Well he's management, right? No accounting for taste there.
2019-03-04 15:29:20	laches1sm	:joy: don’t worry i taught him some vi

2019-03-04 15:31:10	Noodles	I think it's the default on Debian these days too.
2019-03-04 15:31:12	laches1sm	you also see a lot of folk using it to install Arch
2019-03-04 15:31:28	Noodles	(it used to be one of the vi clones, but apparently that's not helpful)
2019-03-04 23:41:26	dsrkane	@tyndyll, I'm an idiot and clean forgot to look in Farset for that tonight. :facepalm: I'll take a look next time I'm down, sorry!
2019-03-05 09:31:27	philtweir	Not 100% sure where this fits _but_ anyone know where to start (or even a brand on Amazon) to replace a MacBook hard drive? Asking for a friend
2019-03-05 09:32:52	philtweir	Terabyte was suggested, but apparently there's quite a range of options. I, as you might imagine, haven't a clue
2019-03-05 09:34:26	peter.reid	what model of macbook do you know?
2019-03-05 09:34:34	peter.reid	tends to vary from model to model

2019-03-05 10:54:13	mistralol	don't suppose anyone knows of any tools to produce a call graph for a c++ program from a binary?
2019-03-05 10:54:21	mistralol	without actually running the code
2019-03-05 11:04:23	lskillen	@mistralol - I got curious so did a quick search too. Some decent answers here: https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/16081/how-to-generate-the-call-graph-of-a-binary-file - radare2 and angr (a python framework) look rather interesting. (edited)
2019-03-05 11:05:30	lskillen	Look at dat graphics: https://www.radare.org/r/img/webui-graph.png
2019-03-05 11:05:30		848x806px image
2019-03-05 11:20:34	tyndyll	@philtweir Easiest thing to do is just phone Macsys and get them to do it [:this:1]
2019-03-05 11:34:23	mistralol	radare looks interesting... Been trying to make a dot file for 30 minutes now :disappointed:
2019-03-05 11:54:04	Noodles	I have never managed to get the hang of radare. I know it's probably what I want some of the time, but the steep learning curve just means I go back to objdump.
2019-03-05 13:26:04	mistralol	I can see why as well :confused:
2019-03-05 13:43:44	lskillen	http://angr.io (angr.io) looks interesting too, and it's written in Python, installable via pip (edited)

2019-03-05 15:38:13	Noodles	Hey, sweet. I submitted a PR to systemd to fix my laptop keymap out of the box and now that fix is in Debian. The system works sometimes. ;) [:party-parrot:3 :tada:2]
2019-03-05 15:54:25	mistralol	How much lag was there?
2019-03-05 15:56:50	Noodles	About a month? TBH I didn't expect it to make Buster.
2019-03-05 16:13:51	keith.maxwell	A PR? What happened to patches, mailing lists and open standards? A PR is a proprietary GitHub thing right? :trolldance:
2019-03-05 16:14:09	keith.maxwell	On a more serious not that is cool, I was expecting much more delay
2019-03-05 16:23:12	mistralol	no a pr is a git thing
2019-03-05 16:27:39	mistralol	looked specially timed before buster was released :smile:
2019-03-05 16:38:29	Noodles	@keith.maxwell: systemd is maintained in GitHub so it was a GitHub style PR. Does make drive-by contributions easy, I'll give it that... [:heart:1]
2019-03-05 17:12:26	keith.maxwell	@mistralol PRs are a more a GitHub thing than a git thing, even the section in the git book talks about GitHub https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project ; some open source projects refuse to mandate GitHub workflows because it isn't free (libre) enough, other's like systemd it appears just get on with life :smile:
2019-03-05 17:13:41	Noodles	I think GitHub popularised the "PR" concept, but I'm sure Linus talks about "pull requests" for pulls to the kernel.
2019-03-05 17:14:28	sigma	But git pull-request... :) 
2019-03-05 17:15:32	mistralol	@keith.maxwell I don't agree :slightly_smiling_face: But github kinda does them differently and somewhat incorrectly (nobody seems to notice this either) from the original intention of git
2019-03-05 17:16:32	Noodles	Why incorrectly?
2019-03-05 17:17:04	sigma	I was wrong, it'd request-pull https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull
2019-03-05 17:17:06	keith.maxwell	Should we talk about `rp`? The only built in command I can see is `git request-pull` which helps with an email
2019-03-05 17:17:21	keith.maxwell	@sigma jinx! :smile:
2019-03-05 17:17:25	mistralol	Its the forced fork on the github side. fork's need maintained and the clone -> hack -> fork -> push to fork breaks a bunch of useful git functions in the local copy
2019-03-05 17:18:06	Noodles	How do you avoid the fork without allowing people to other people's repos without any checks?
2019-03-05 17:18:36	Noodles	I'm not sure I've lost any functionality by having multiple remote repos for things I've worked on.
2019-03-05 17:18:45	mistralol	The "clone" is the fork or should be enough of a fork from the original repo for a non maintained to edit and send a patch for review / inclusion.
2019-03-05 17:19:00	mistralol	so the original method of this way by mailing a "git format-patch" (edited)
2019-03-05 17:19:06	Noodles	The "clone" is not publicly accessible.
2019-03-05 17:19:17	sigma	You could have a general request pull from random git enabled URL feature
2019-03-05 17:19:27	Noodles	GH provides some public hosting of repos, along with a neat way of tying those repos with their "parents".
2019-03-05 17:19:30	mistralol	the clone doesn't need to be publicly accessible. The patch does
2019-03-05 17:19:35	sigma	But yeh would need a Public git repo somewhere
2019-03-05 17:20:00	Noodles	GH doesn't stop normal git workflow. You can send me an email patch and I can apply it to my git checkout and push.
2019-03-05 17:20:07	Noodles	It just adds an additional method.
2019-03-05 17:20:22	sigma	Mistralol, you might like http://sr.ht (sr.ht) 
2019-03-05 17:20:28	mistralol	Yeah I get that too But how come github doesn't have a "submit patch" button without the fork?
2019-03-05 17:20:51	Noodles	And cut and paste the patch into it?
2019-03-05 17:21:07	mistralol	or a shell script to do a git format-patch and upload it?
2019-03-05 17:21:20	Noodles	Upload it to *where*?
2019-03-05 17:21:26	mistralol	github....
2019-03-05 17:21:45	Noodles	In a private repo, like, say, a fork of the original in the namespace of the patch submitter?
2019-03-05 17:22:06	sigma	Same places as the issues get stored maybe?
2019-03-05 17:22:20	sigma	Not sure how you'd implement it
2019-03-05 17:22:43	mistralol	The clone -> push to fork. The moment you fork + push you actually technically become a sub maintainer if the repo is public. So you cannot locally use such things like git rebase -i etc.. because you cannot push to the fork again without doing a forced override
2019-03-05 17:23:45	sigma	Out of curiousity has anyone else got an http://sr.ht (sr.ht) account?
2019-03-05 17:23:51	Noodles	I regularly rebase in forks in the same way as I regularly rebase in private clones. Not sure what the issue is? You shouldn't assume my clones are always linearly updated. ;)
2019-03-05 17:23:55	sigma	It really is quite nice
2019-03-05 17:24:05	mistralol	So if your patch is rejected. You end up having to do another commit + push. At the point the PR now has multiple commits against it based on code review/rejection. The maintainer then has to clean up the submitter's mess which puts more load on a central person
2019-03-05 17:24:26	Noodles	If you have a rejected PR you can update the PR branch and the PR gets automagically updated.
2019-03-05 17:25:13	Noodles	I'd just like to point out I'm more than happy with traditional git work flows and email patches, but I do think GitHub have usefully lowered the barrier to contributions.
2019-03-05 17:25:23	mistralol	yeah i know. But then you have a string of commits right? Then the maintainer is the only one who can clean that up. Cause if somebody decides to fork your fork you can't squash any more?
2019-03-05 17:25:28	Noodles	The objections I've seen about them is the locking in of the non-git metadata (such as issues)
2019-03-05 17:25:49	Noodles	If someone forks my working fork then fork them.
2019-03-05 17:26:05	Noodles	Caveat emptor.
2019-03-05 17:26:11	mistralol	can you see where i am coming from though?
2019-03-05 17:26:41	sigma	git series is also nice for this kind of thing, you an rebase patch series, review comments and all
2019-03-05 17:26:46	Noodles	You seem to object to the fact the submission is public and that therefore creates (in your eyes) a certain expectation upon that repo.
2019-03-05 17:27:02	Noodles	In this scene I will be playing @sigma and you will be playing me.
2019-03-05 17:27:29	sigma	Lol
2019-03-05 17:27:31	mistralol	ok, not confused at all now :stuck_out_tongue:
2019-03-05 17:27:47	Noodles	It's a bit of a rusty joke.
2019-03-05 17:27:58	mistralol	so its dead then? :smile: [:ferris:2]
2019-03-05 17:28:19	sigma	We've been on opposite sides of a similar philosophical debate today already :) 
2019-03-05 17:28:21	Noodles	I just got another PR merged. Rockin' [:tada:3 :party-parrot:1]
2019-03-05 17:28:57	sigma	The only PRs I've got done lately was to @philtweir's repo...
2019-03-05 17:29:36	sigma	But seriously, anyone els played with http://sr.ht (sr.ht)? :) 
2019-03-05 17:29:54	mistralol	no what is it?
2019-03-05 17:30:17	laches1sm	I’m curious
2019-03-05 17:30:17	mistralol	I also cannot get to sourcehut :confused:
2019-03-05 17:30:41	mistralol	Personally I prefer gerrit's workflow btw :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)
2019-03-05 17:31:55	Noodles	We use gerrit in work and I don't hate it for review stuff.
2019-03-05 17:32:02	sigma	https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-discuss
2019-03-05 17:32:38	mistralol	@sigma that something more like gerrit than github?
2019-03-05 17:32:45	sigma	http://sr.ht (sr.ht) is pretty much gitlab but with more conventional tools for interaction 
2019-03-05 17:33:13	sigma	So you _can_ mail patches etc, the repos have mailing lists etc (edited)
2019-03-05 17:34:07	sigma	It's still pretty alpha, but well enough funded to be self supporting afair
2019-03-05 17:34:51	keith.maxwell	Think http://sr.ht (sr.ht) is the old name and current short url, as of last month the official front page is https://sourcehut.org/
2019-03-05 17:34:51		sourcehut - the hacker's forge
2019-03-05 17:34:51		sourcehut is a network of useful open source tools for software project maintainers and collaborators, including git repos, bug tracking, continuous integration, and mailing lists. [:+1:1]
2019-03-05 17:35:06	keith.maxwell	My experience with it so far is limited to reading the main contributor's blog
2019-03-05 17:35:52	sigma	I've a couple of invites if anyone wants to give it a go
2019-03-05 17:35:54	mistralol	The http://sourcehut.org (sourcehut.org) is blocked by firewall here :wink: [:facepalm:1]
2019-03-05 17:36:54	sigma	It's also all free software
2019-03-05 17:40:30	keith.maxwell	Good point! I think that's why I started the thread off - I had been pretty much exclusively on GitLab which is all free (and calls the same thing a MR) but I'm starting to use Azure DevOps with its more sophisticated issue tracking (almost Jira like, I think) and well its less free
2019-03-05 17:41:46	Noodles	GitLab is not 100% Free.
2019-03-05 17:42:01	Noodles	It has a Community Edition, which is Free.
2019-03-05 17:44:15	keith.maxwell	Might be that's a misconception on my part, I haven't set up the community edition recently, anyone know the big differences? (edited)

2019-03-05 17:45:32	Noodles	I know they moved a bunch of stuff to the community edition to make it useful for the GNOME and Debian folk.
2019-03-05 17:45:36	keith.maxwell	@mistralol does that help? I can't find the words community edition anywhere on that page?
2019-03-05 17:45:44	mistralol	core = free i think [:+1:1]
2019-03-05 17:47:25	sigma	Yeh, they're open core the same way the likes of puppet are
2019-03-05 17:49:02	mistralol	meanwhile I am still stuck with svn here :confused:
2019-03-05 17:49:39	Noodles	We just have the hardware folk left on svn.
2019-03-05 17:50:21	sigma	git-svn is actually pretty nice once you get over the initial import hump
2019-03-05 17:50:28	mistralol	Yeah we have a problem with it
2019-03-05 17:50:49	mistralol	Somebody a long time ago had a great idea to use the code repo for rpm's :wink:
2019-03-05 17:50:57	mistralol	so we have a serious "size" problem
2019-03-05 17:51:26	sigma	Yeh, your filter list to exclude those would get big
2019-03-05 17:51:52	mistralol	well at least they are mostly in a single path and they are above the main code
2019-03-05 17:52:09	mistralol	but how do people normally manage quite a large collection of rpm's out of a repo?
2019-03-05 17:52:54	mistralol	ideally including the building and signing stages
2019-03-05 17:53:28	mistralol	but preferably without setting up a complete distro set of infrastructure for dealing with it
2019-03-05 17:53:32	sigma	Ignore-paths on git svn is a good start
2019-03-05 17:53:57	sigma	Ahh, sorry, thought you were asking how to get them out of the repo :) 
2019-03-05 17:54:10	mistralol	Well... find . -type f -name "*.rpm" .......... | xargs NUKE (edited)
2019-03-05 17:54:30	sigma	That doesn't help with the history :P
2019-03-05 17:54:53	sigma	Svn seems a reasonable thing to manage binaries in (edited)
2019-03-05 17:55:14	mistralol	not really concerned about the history so much on the rpm and the changelog in them are mostly (I think) correct
2019-03-05 17:55:16	sigma	Now there's git lfs
2019-03-05 17:57:39	mistralol	don't support to know how it deals with a clone or fork?
2019-03-05 17:58:32	mistralol	the history of this stuff is 180GB+ btw.
2019-03-05 19:12:26	sigma	If you clone it it doesn't necessarily pull all the LFS files
2019-03-07 14:24:51	willix	@jonnymccullagh said BelFOSS is open for registration:
2019-03-07 14:24:51		https://belfoss.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/
2019-03-07 14:24:51		BelFOSS | Free and Open Source Software Conference
2019-03-07 14:24:51		Great to have Proofpoint on-board as sponsors of BelFOSS 2019. Attendees of BelFOSS 2017 will remember Jolene Dunne describing Proofpoint's email security and we hope to hear more from them at BelFOSS 2019. Proofpoint's Belfast office is in Weaver's Court close to the Europa and Farset Labs. [:sweat_smile:1]
2019-03-07 14:27:31	Noodles	I was sure registration had been open before?
2019-03-07 14:29:45	mayc	Woohoo, I think I can go this year.
2019-03-07 14:30:15	jonnymccullagh	Yeah it's been open for a while @Noodles - I'm just now spending a few hours drumming up support!
2019-03-07 14:30:29	Noodles	I can't find any record of having actually signed up.
2019-03-07 14:30:37	jonnymccullagh	Great May @mayc maybe you could join the discussion panel
2019-03-07 14:30:56	jonnymccullagh	Don't worry Jonathan - you are on the list !
2019-03-07 14:31:20	jonnymccullagh	I need to send out emails to registered folks - need to sort out my SMTP creds first though
2019-03-07 14:31:29	jonnymccullagh	And wild busy with this minecraft project
2019-03-07 14:31:33	jonnymccullagh	and work of course
2019-03-07 14:32:03	mayc	Wait, what?  :laughing:
2019-03-07 14:36:51	paddycarey	oh nice, just across the road from my new office too :smile:
2019-03-07 14:38:10	mayc	That's handy!
2019-03-07 15:36:03	bolster	@jonnymccullagh what? no “SLACK” option in “how did you find out about belfoss?”
2019-03-07 16:06:12	jonnymccullagh	:shame: (hides in shame)
2019-03-07 16:16:11	lskillen	I giggled at the age ranges on the BelFOSS registration - If you're 35, you're almost certainly picking that 25-35 range rather than the 35-45 range. :grinning: (edited) [:lol:1 :party_try_not_to_cry:3]
2019-03-07 16:40:43	willix	I don't know when BelFOSS actucally opened :thinking_face:
2019-03-07 16:40:43		I received an email from Jonny and sent a reminder to drum up support within BLUG.... (edited)
2019-03-07 16:55:10	Noodles	I think you wanted :thinking_face:...

2019-03-02 14:13:04	peter.reid	they were still using one at the school my mum used to work at when she was left, and that was only 7 years ago [:joy:1]

2019-03-02 16:44:10	alanfoster	TIL there exists physical turtles :o
2019-03-02 16:49:04	mistralol	@Noodles I used one as a kid. They were like bigtrack they used to never turn accuratly

2019-03-02 23:18:08	tyndyll	That used to be the retort to a friend of ours - “Do you remember the falklands? I don’t”. It finally bit me on the arse when someone hit me with “Do you remember the first gulf war? I don’t”... 
2019-03-02 23:18:29	peter.reid	there was a first gulf war?

2019-03-02 23:22:24	laches1sm	is that when folk get upset after too much code golf?

2019-03-04 15:28:24	mistralol	pico = nano before it separated from pine
2019-03-04 15:28:35	laches1sm	nah, it was def nano
2019-03-04 15:28:54	laches1sm	was helping with some dockerfile fuckery and he opens up nano :sad-parrot:
2019-03-04 15:29:07	Noodles	Well he's management, right? No accounting for taste there.
2019-03-04 15:29:20	laches1sm	:joy: don’t worry i taught him some vi
2019-03-04 15:29:58	philtweir	But maybe taste for accounting? [:fast-parrot:1]
2019-03-04 15:30:42	tyndyll	Nano was the default on FreeBSD for a while? [:this:1]
2019-03-04 15:31:10	Noodles	I think it's the default on Debian these days too.
2019-03-04 15:31:12	laches1sm	you also see a lot of folk using it to install Arch
2019-03-04 15:31:28	Noodles	(it used to be one of the vi clones, but apparently that's not helpful)
2019-03-04 23:41:26	dsrkane	@tyndyll, I'm an idiot and clean forgot to look in Farset for that tonight. :facepalm: I'll take a look next time I'm down, sorry!
2019-03-05 09:31:27	philtweir	Not 100% sure where this fits _but_ anyone know where to start (or even a brand on Amazon) to replace a MacBook hard drive? Asking for a friend
2019-03-05 09:32:52	philtweir	Terabyte was suggested, but apparently there's quite a range of options. I, as you might imagine, haven't a clue
2019-03-05 09:34:26	peter.reid	what model of macbook do you know?
2019-03-05 09:34:34	peter.reid	tends to vary from model to model

2019-03-05 10:54:13	mistralol	don't suppose anyone knows of any tools to produce a call graph for a c++ program from a binary?
2019-03-05 10:54:21	mistralol	without actually running the code
2019-03-05 11:04:23	lskillen	@mistralol - I got curious so did a quick search too. Some decent answers here: https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/16081/how-to-generate-the-call-graph-of-a-binary-file - radare2 and angr (a python framework) look rather interesting. (edited)
2019-03-05 11:05:30	lskillen	Look at dat graphics: https://www.radare.org/r/img/webui-graph.png
2019-03-05 11:05:30		848x806px image
2019-03-05 11:20:34	tyndyll	@philtweir Easiest thing to do is just phone Macsys and get them to do it [:this:1]
2019-03-05 11:34:23	mistralol	radare looks interesting... Been trying to make a dot file for 30 minutes now :disappointed:
2019-03-05 11:54:04	Noodles	I have never managed to get the hang of radare. I know it's probably what I want some of the time, but the steep learning curve just means I go back to objdump.
2019-03-05 13:26:04	mistralol	I can see why as well :confused:
2019-03-05 13:43:44	lskillen	http://angr.io (angr.io) looks interesting too, and it's written in Python, installable via pip (edited)

2019-03-05 15:38:13	Noodles	Hey, sweet. I submitted a PR to systemd to fix my laptop keymap out of the box and now that fix is in Debian. The system works sometimes. ;) [:party-parrot:3 :tada:2]
2019-03-05 15:54:25	mistralol	How much lag was there?
2019-03-05 15:56:50	Noodles	About a month? TBH I didn't expect it to make Buster.
2019-03-05 16:13:51	keith.maxwell	A PR? What happened to patches, mailing lists and open standards? A PR is a proprietary GitHub thing right? :trolldance:
2019-03-05 16:14:09	keith.maxwell	On a more serious not that is cool, I was expecting much more delay
2019-03-05 16:23:12	mistralol	no a pr is a git thing
2019-03-05 16:27:39	mistralol	looked specially timed before buster was released :smile:
2019-03-05 16:38:29	Noodles	@keith.maxwell: systemd is maintained in GitHub so it was a GitHub style PR. Does make drive-by contributions easy, I'll give it that... [:heart:1]
2019-03-05 17:12:26	keith.maxwell	@mistralol PRs are a more a GitHub thing than a git thing, even the section in the git book talks about GitHub https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project ; some open source projects refuse to mandate GitHub workflows because it isn't free (libre) enough, other's like systemd it appears just get on with life :smile:
2019-03-05 17:13:41	Noodles	I think GitHub popularised the "PR" concept, but I'm sure Linus talks about "pull requests" for pulls to the kernel.
2019-03-05 17:14:28	sigma	But git pull-request... :) 
2019-03-05 17:15:32	mistralol	@keith.maxwell I don't agree :slightly_smiling_face: But github kinda does them differently and somewhat incorrectly (nobody seems to notice this either) from the original intention of git
2019-03-05 17:16:32	Noodles	Why incorrectly?
2019-03-05 17:17:04	sigma	I was wrong, it'd request-pull https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull
2019-03-05 17:17:06	keith.maxwell	Should we talk about `rp`? The only built in command I can see is `git request-pull` which helps with an email
2019-03-05 17:17:21	keith.maxwell	@sigma jinx! :smile:
2019-03-05 17:17:25	mistralol	Its the forced fork on the github side. fork's need maintained and the clone -> hack -> fork -> push to fork breaks a bunch of useful git functions in the local copy
2019-03-05 17:18:06	Noodles	How do you avoid the fork without allowing people to other people's repos without any checks?
2019-03-05 17:18:36	Noodles	I'm not sure I've lost any functionality by having multiple remote repos for things I've worked on.
2019-03-05 17:18:45	mistralol	The "clone" is the fork or should be enough of a fork from the original repo for a non maintained to edit and send a patch for review / inclusion.
2019-03-05 17:19:00	mistralol	so the original method of this way by mailing a "git format-patch" (edited)
2019-03-05 17:19:06	Noodles	The "clone" is not publicly accessible.
2019-03-05 17:19:17	sigma	You could have a general request pull from random git enabled URL feature
2019-03-05 17:19:27	Noodles	GH provides some public hosting of repos, along with a neat way of tying those repos with their "parents".
2019-03-05 17:19:30	mistralol	the clone doesn't need to be publicly accessible. The patch does
2019-03-05 17:19:35	sigma	But yeh would need a Public git repo somewhere
2019-03-05 17:20:00	Noodles	GH doesn't stop normal git workflow. You can send me an email patch and I can apply it to my git checkout and push.
2019-03-05 17:20:07	Noodles	It just adds an additional method.
2019-03-05 17:20:22	sigma	Mistralol, you might like http://sr.ht (sr.ht) 
2019-03-05 17:20:28	mistralol	Yeah I get that too But how come github doesn't have a "submit patch" button without the fork?
2019-03-05 17:20:51	Noodles	And cut and paste the patch into it?
2019-03-05 17:21:07	mistralol	or a shell script to do a git format-patch and upload it?
2019-03-05 17:21:20	Noodles	Upload it to *where*?
2019-03-05 17:21:26	mistralol	github....
2019-03-05 17:21:45	Noodles	In a private repo, like, say, a fork of the original in the namespace of the patch submitter?
2019-03-05 17:22:06	sigma	Same places as the issues get stored maybe?
2019-03-05 17:22:20	sigma	Not sure how you'd implement it
2019-03-05 17:22:43	mistralol	The clone -> push to fork. The moment you fork + push you actually technically become a sub maintainer if the repo is public. So you cannot locally use such things like git rebase -i etc.. because you cannot push to the fork again without doing a forced override
2019-03-05 17:23:45	sigma	Out of curiousity has anyone else got an http://sr.ht (sr.ht) account?
2019-03-05 17:23:51	Noodles	I regularly rebase in forks in the same way as I regularly rebase in private clones. Not sure what the issue is? You shouldn't assume my clones are always linearly updated. ;)
2019-03-05 17:23:55	sigma	It really is quite nice
2019-03-05 17:24:05	mistralol	So if your patch is rejected. You end up having to do another commit + push. At the point the PR now has multiple commits against it based on code review/rejection. The maintainer then has to clean up the submitter's mess which puts more load on a central person
2019-03-05 17:24:26	Noodles	If you have a rejected PR you can update the PR branch and the PR gets automagically updated.
2019-03-05 17:25:13	Noodles	I'd just like to point out I'm more than happy with traditional git work flows and email patches, but I do think GitHub have usefully lowered the barrier to contributions.
2019-03-05 17:25:23	mistralol	yeah i know. But then you have a string of commits right? Then the maintainer is the only one who can clean that up. Cause if somebody decides to fork your fork you can't squash any more?
2019-03-05 17:25:28	Noodles	The objections I've seen about them is the locking in of the non-git metadata (such as issues)
2019-03-05 17:25:49	Noodles	If someone forks my working fork then fork them.
2019-03-05 17:26:05	Noodles	Caveat emptor.
2019-03-05 17:26:11	mistralol	can you see where i am coming from though?
2019-03-05 17:26:41	sigma	git series is also nice for this kind of thing, you an rebase patch series, review comments and all
2019-03-05 17:26:46	Noodles	You seem to object to the fact the submission is public and that therefore creates (in your eyes) a certain expectation upon that repo.
2019-03-05 17:27:02	Noodles	In this scene I will be playing @sigma and you will be playing me.
2019-03-05 17:27:29	sigma	Lol
2019-03-05 17:27:31	mistralol	ok, not confused at all now :stuck_out_tongue:
2019-03-05 17:27:47	Noodles	It's a bit of a rusty joke.
2019-03-05 17:27:58	mistralol	so its dead then? :smile: [:ferris:2]
2019-03-05 17:28:19	sigma	We've been on opposite sides of a similar philosophical debate today already :) 
2019-03-05 17:28:21	Noodles	I just got another PR merged. Rockin' [:tada:3 :party-parrot:1]
2019-03-05 17:28:57	sigma	The only PRs I've got done lately was to @philtweir's repo...
2019-03-05 17:29:36	sigma	But seriously, anyone els played with http://sr.ht (sr.ht)? :) 
2019-03-05 17:29:54	mistralol	no what is it?
2019-03-05 17:30:17	laches1sm	I’m curious
2019-03-05 17:30:17	mistralol	I also cannot get to sourcehut :confused:
2019-03-05 17:30:41	mistralol	Personally I prefer gerrit's workflow btw :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)
2019-03-05 17:31:55	Noodles	We use gerrit in work and I don't hate it for review stuff.
2019-03-05 17:32:02	sigma	https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-discuss
2019-03-05 17:32:38	mistralol	@sigma that something more like gerrit than github?
2019-03-05 17:32:45	sigma	http://sr.ht (sr.ht) is pretty much gitlab but with more conventional tools for interaction 
2019-03-05 17:33:13	sigma	So you _can_ mail patches etc, the repos have mailing lists etc (edited)
2019-03-05 17:34:07	sigma	It's still pretty alpha, but well enough funded to be self supporting afair
2019-03-05 17:34:51	keith.maxwell	Think http://sr.ht (sr.ht) is the old name and current short url, as of last month the official front page is https://sourcehut.org/
2019-03-05 17:34:51		sourcehut - the hacker's forge
2019-03-05 17:34:51		sourcehut is a network of useful open source tools for software project maintainers and collaborators, including git repos, bug tracking, continuous integration, and mailing lists. [:+1:1]
2019-03-05 17:35:06	keith.maxwell	My experience with it so far is limited to reading the main contributor's blog
2019-03-05 17:35:52	sigma	I've a couple of invites if anyone wants to give it a go
2019-03-05 17:35:54	mistralol	The http://sourcehut.org (sourcehut.org) is blocked by firewall here :wink: [:facepalm:1]
2019-03-05 17:36:54	sigma	It's also all free software
2019-03-05 17:40:30	keith.maxwell	Good point! I think that's why I started the thread off - I had been pretty much exclusively on GitLab which is all free (and calls the same thing a MR) but I'm starting to use Azure DevOps with its more sophisticated issue tracking (almost Jira like, I think) and well its less free
2019-03-05 17:41:46	Noodles	GitLab is not 100% Free.
2019-03-05 17:42:01	Noodles	It has a Community Edition, which is Free.
2019-03-05 17:44:15	keith.maxwell	Might be that's a misconception on my part, I haven't set up the community edition recently, anyone know the big differences? (edited)
2019-03-05 17:44:46	mistralol	https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/self-managed/feature-comparison/
2019-03-05 17:44:46		Products Full Feature Comparison

2019-03-05 17:45:32	Noodles	I know they moved a bunch of stuff to the community edition to make it useful for the GNOME and Debian folk.
2019-03-05 17:45:36	keith.maxwell	@mistralol does that help? I can't find the words community edition anywhere on that page?
2019-03-05 17:45:44	mistralol	core = free i think [:+1:1]
2019-03-05 17:47:25	sigma	Yeh, they're open core the same way the likes of puppet are
2019-03-05 17:49:02	mistralol	meanwhile I am still stuck with svn here :confused:
2019-03-05 17:49:39	Noodles	We just have the hardware folk left on svn.
2019-03-05 17:50:21	sigma	git-svn is actually pretty nice once you get over the initial import hump
2019-03-05 17:50:28	mistralol	Yeah we have a problem with it
2019-03-05 17:50:49	mistralol	Somebody a long time ago had a great idea to use the code repo for rpm's :wink:
2019-03-05 17:50:57	mistralol	so we have a serious "size" problem
2019-03-05 17:51:26	sigma	Yeh, your filter list to exclude those would get big
2019-03-05 17:51:52	mistralol	well at least they are mostly in a single path and they are above the main code
2019-03-05 17:52:09	mistralol	but how do people normally manage quite a large collection of rpm's out of a repo?
2019-03-05 17:52:54	mistralol	ideally including the building and signing stages
2019-03-05 17:53:28	mistralol	but preferably without setting up a complete distro set of infrastructure for dealing with it
2019-03-05 17:53:32	sigma	Ignore-paths on git svn is a good start
2019-03-05 17:53:57	sigma	Ahh, sorry, thought you were asking how to get them out of the repo :) 
2019-03-05 17:54:10	mistralol	Well... find . -type f -name "*.rpm" .......... | xargs NUKE (edited)
2019-03-05 17:54:30	sigma	That doesn't help with the history :P
2019-03-05 17:54:53	sigma	Svn seems a reasonable thing to manage binaries in (edited)
2019-03-05 17:55:14	mistralol	not really concerned about the history so much on the rpm and the changelog in them are mostly (I think) correct
2019-03-05 17:55:16	sigma	Now there's git lfs
2019-03-05 17:57:39	mistralol	don't support to know how it deals with a clone or fork?
2019-03-05 17:58:32	mistralol	the history of this stuff is 180GB+ btw.
2019-03-05 19:12:26	sigma	If you clone it it doesn't necessarily pull all the LFS files
2019-03-07 14:24:51	willix	@jonnymccullagh said BelFOSS is open for registration:
2019-03-07 14:24:51		https://belfoss.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/
2019-03-07 14:24:51		BelFOSS | Free and Open Source Software Conference
2019-03-07 14:24:51		Great to have Proofpoint on-board as sponsors of BelFOSS 2019. Attendees of BelFOSS 2017 will remember Jolene Dunne describing Proofpoint's email security and we hope to hear more from them at BelFOSS 2019. Proofpoint's Belfast office is in Weaver's Court close to the Europa and Farset Labs. [:sweat_smile:1]
2019-03-07 14:27:31	Noodles	I was sure registration had been open before?
2019-03-07 14:29:45	mayc	Woohoo, I think I can go this year.
2019-03-07 14:30:15	jonnymccullagh	Yeah it's been open for a while @Noodles - I'm just now spending a few hours drumming up support!
2019-03-07 14:30:29	Noodles	I can't find any record of having actually signed up.
2019-03-07 14:30:37	jonnymccullagh	Great May @mayc maybe you could join the discussion panel
2019-03-07 14:30:56	jonnymccullagh	Don't worry Jonathan - you are on the list !
2019-03-07 14:31:20	jonnymccullagh	I need to send out emails to registered folks - need to sort out my SMTP creds first though
2019-03-07 14:31:29	jonnymccullagh	And wild busy with this minecraft project
2019-03-07 14:31:33	jonnymccullagh	and work of course
2019-03-07 14:32:03	mayc	Wait, what?  :laughing:
2019-03-07 14:36:51	paddycarey	oh nice, just across the road from my new office too :smile:
2019-03-07 14:38:10	mayc	That's handy!
2019-03-07 15:36:03	bolster	@jonnymccullagh what? no “SLACK” option in “how did you find out about belfoss?”
2019-03-07 16:06:12	jonnymccullagh	:shame: (hides in shame)
2019-03-07 16:16:11	lskillen	I giggled at the age ranges on the BelFOSS registration - If you're 35, you're almost certainly picking that 25-35 range rather than the 35-45 range. :grinning: (edited) [:lol:1 :party_try_not_to_cry:3]
2019-03-07 16:40:43	willix	I don't know when BelFOSS actucally opened :thinking_face:
2019-03-07 16:40:43		I received an email from Jonny and sent a reminder to drum up support within BLUG.... (edited)
2019-03-07 16:55:10	Noodles	I think you wanted :thinking_face:...
2019-03-07 16:57:37	philtweir	emm...??

2019-03-07 17:57:36	willix	Indeed, Noodles I wanted :thinking_face:
