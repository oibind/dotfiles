2019-03-06 14:24:21	SideSwipe	What's the difference between #social-irl and #social? :thinking_face:
2019-03-06 14:25:34	bolster	#social is tied to Farset’s social media accounts and mentions (although has recently just been twitter spam by content marketers…)
2019-03-06 14:26:16	bolster	in theory #social-irl is like #wee-pints in NITD for planning IRL socialisation, aka, going to the pub :smile:
2019-03-06 15:12:34	glenn	real-life: like being spammed by content marketers, but old-school - using bill-boards, branding and over-loud music.

2019-03-06 15:17:50	e.m.	lets be rebels and do _real life_
2019-03-06 15:38:36	SideSwipe	Maybe rename #social to social-media to make that distinction clearer from a quick glance at the channel list? 
2019-03-06 15:39:51	SideSwipe	I should probably also join NITD at some point 
2019-03-07 14:57:20	stealthii	@stealthii set the channel purpose: For chatter about IRL events and meetups involving Farset members in a social capacity.
2019-03-07 14:57:29	--	@stealthii set the channel topic: Beers when
2019-03-07 15:00:15	SideSwipe	That works too! :+1:
